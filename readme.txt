Pushowl enables you to re-engage your customers through web push notifications. In under 5 minutes setup push notifications for your site.

== Description ==

Installing the Pushowl plugin will insert a javascript code in your Wordpress website, thereby enabling you to use browser based push notifications. We have a comprehensive getting started guide on push notifications at https://blog.pushowl.com.

Pushowl is an all in one suite to engage and re-engage your web traffic. Firstly, it adds a smart notification pane on your website, which helps the on-site audience discover the latest content. Secondly, it leverages browser push notification technology to reach out to off-site customers. As compared to traditional re-engagement tools like emails, browser push notifications have been known to be 10x-50x more effective. All elements of pushowl are highly customizable to look like native elements of the page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `pushowl` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In the setting menu, just enter your subdomain value, which can be found in the Setting Pane after you login to Pushowl Dashboard
